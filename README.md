# Rock Paper Scissors

A classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a simple computer. I began with a console-only version then later refactored my code to work with a simple UI.

Some of the new lessons I learned include:
* Using the **viewport meta tag** to enable media query usage
* Integrate web fonts
* Create **responsive design** for smaller screens
* Use **media queries** to set breakpoints in which layout should be adjusted
* Use JavaScript methods to manipulate the site's **DOM**
* Use **event listeners** to run functions based on user input
* Target element on which event listener was fired
* **Refactor** code previously written to expand functionality
* Use a **vector graphics editor** ([Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)) to modify artwork (in accordance with the licensing terms) and convert to PNG format for web use

Some of the techniques I learned while working on the console-only version were:

* **Planning** my program prior to coding
* Differentiating between **constants** and **let** variables
* Creating a simple **array**
* Creating a **random number generator** 
  * Using **Math.floor()** to round down and give equal chances of generating random numbers starting at 0, and ending at specified number
  * Using **Math.random()** and a **parameter** to define number range
* Using **AND**, **OR** and **NOT** logical operators
* Creating **if** & **if else** statements
* Passing in **arguments** to a function
* Using **strict equal to** in order to check for type and value equality
