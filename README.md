# Rock Paper Scissors

A classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a simple computer. This version is played through window prompts and results are displayed in the browser console.

Some of the techniques I learned include:
* **Planning** my program prior to coding
* Differentiating between **constants** and **let** variables
* Creating a simple **array**
* Creating a **random number generator** 
  * Using **Math.floor()** to round down and give equal chances of generating random numbers starting at 0, and ending at specified number
  * Using **Math.random()** and a **parameter** to define number range
* Using **AND**, **OR** and **NOT** logical operators
* Creating **if** & **if else** statements
* Passing in **arguments** to a function
* Using **strict equal to** in order to check for type and value equality
